## Definitions

To use the Platform and Services, you, the Candidate, must be at least 14 years old. To enter into contracts with the COMPANY, you must have full legal capacity according to the legislation of your country, that is, be at least 18 years old or be 14 years old with the consent of your parents or legal guardian.

COMPANIES are companies that use the HRecruiter Platform to advertise job opportunities or to capture a pool of qualified candidates to identify potential talents among them, selecting them to join their team. Job openings will be published in the "Work with Us" area of the company's careers page.

For the purposes of these Terms, when we use the term USERS, we are referring to you, Candidates in general, and COMPANIES.

## Changes

These Terms may be changed from time to time for valid reasons. Whenever there is a relevant change, HRecruiter will make its best efforts to communicate with you and request a new acceptance of the most updated version. However, we ask that you visit this page periodically to check the most recent Terms established for using the HRecruiter Platform.

## Application of these Terms

These Terms will apply to you as soon as you start using the HRecruiter Platform by creating a user account and will only cease to apply if and when your account is canceled by HRecruiter or terminated by you. If your account is subsequently reactivated, these Terms will apply to you again, in their current version.

HRecruiter may cancel accounts and take all appropriate legal measures in case of violation of these Terms by USERS.

## Services provided by HRecruiter

HRecruiter offers the following Services for COMPANIES:

- Mapping of COMPANIES' profiles;
- Mapping of your profile, potential, and knowledge through tests provided by HRecruiter or third parties;
- Matching COMPANIES' profiles seeking Candidates and Candidates seeking new work positions, with participation in selection processes to be carried out when job openings are available.

## Your Registration

### Data Accuracy

Your registration must be made when accessing the HRecruiter Platform or the COMPANY's Platform and will only be confirmed upon completion of all requested fields. By accepting these Terms, you commit to completing your registration with accurate, precise, and truthful information and to updating your data whenever there is any change. You can make corrections or changes by editing the information in your profile. HRecruiter will not be responsible for personal data entered incorrectly by Candidates, who may be held civilly and criminally liable for the veracity, accuracy, and authenticity of the registered data.

### Access Account

To use the HRecruiter Platform, HRecruiter will provide you with an account, which will be accessed via email (login) and password. It is prohibited to share this data with third parties, and you will be fully responsible for any use made of it. In case of unauthorized use of your account, you must inform us immediately by opening a ticket, assuming all risks arising from any unauthorized access.

### Social Media Access

You may also access your account through social networks that have a prior connection established with the HRecruiter Platform, such as LinkedIn and Facebook. In this case, the data provided on those sites may be subject to the terms of use and privacy of those platforms.

### Registration from Selection Process

If you register as a result of a selection process, you will only have access to all features of the HRecruiter Platform when you complete the registration process and the test stages provided by the COMPANIES. If you register for more than one selection process during registration, you will have access to all features of the HRecruiter Platform as soon as you complete the registration stages of one of them. Your registration is unique and will be used in all selection processes in which you enroll.

### Referral for Position

If, when registering for a particular selection process, you indicate that you are being referred for the position by a current employee of the COMPANY that opened the selection process, the referral must be validated through the HRecruiter Platform by the person who referred you.

### Data Sharing

Your data will be processed and stored in HRecruiter's database in a secure environment, observing available technologies, and will be shared with those who need to receive it to enable your participation in the selection process, that is, with the COMPANIES conducting such process. In addition to the COMPANY, which will always receive your data, HR or people management consultancies may also conduct the recruitment process, which may (i) open a selection process on behalf of the recruiting company; or (ii) manage a selection process opened by the recruiting company itself. Such COMPANIES may communicate directly with you to conduct the selection process, invite you to apply for other positions, and related matters.

Service providers we hire to help us carry out our activities may also receive your personal information. For more information about sharing your personal data, please access HRecruiter's Privacy Policy.

### Candidate Assignment to Position

The COMPANY may invite you, provided you have previously enrolled in their selection processes, whether these selection processes are still ongoing or not, to participate in selection processes for other open positions that match your profile and skills, always thinking of your benefit and interest in being hired.

### Talent Pool

When applying for a selection process, you become part of the recruiting company's talent pool. Your personal data will be kept even after the selection process is completed. At any time, you may request your exclusion, as indicated in our Privacy Policy.

## User Content

All information, data, texts, programs, music, sounds, photographs, graphics, videos, advertisements, messages, and other materials sent, inserted, or displayed by the Candidate or COMPANY are the sole responsibility of the author of such content.

HRecruiter may take any action it deems necessary or appropriate regarding USER Content if it believes that such content may create liability for HRecruiter, defame its brand or public image, or cause loss of USERS, or its Internet providers or other suppliers (in part or in full).

## Profile Mapping and Tests

On the HRecruiter Platform, you will take online tests used to map your profile, potential, and general knowledge. The tests provided will be taken only once and will be used for all selection processes in which you participate. If you wish, you may retake the tests after 6 (six) months from the first attempt (this rule may change depending on the selection process).

Test results will only be made available to COMPANIES in whose selection processes you enroll. These results will help COMPANIES in selecting Candidates. Any comments or recommendations made about these tests by the COMPANY will only be accessible to the COMPANY and employees designated by it to use the HRecruiter Platform.

The rules on "Data Sharing" provided above also apply to this data.

## Video Recording Stage

Video recording, for cases where the selection process requests it, can be done through the HRecruiter Platform.

Videos must be recorded according to parameters and guidelines pre-established by HRecruiter.

HRecruiter will remove from the platform any video that, according to its criteria, contains inappropriate, illegal content or that discredits HRecruiter's partner companies, in which case the Candidate responsible for the recording will have their registration deleted, in addition to being subject to civil and criminal liability for any damage that the video content may cause to third parties.

You authorize HRecruiter to share your image by making the recorded video available to client COMPANIES.

Unlike tests, videos will only be used for the selection process for which they are recorded and will not be used for future selection processes for positions opened by other companies.

Videos, as well as any comments or recommendations made about the videos by the COMPANY, will only be accessible to the COMPANY and employees designated by it to use the HRecruiter Platform. The rules on "Data Sharing" provided above also apply to this data.

## Interview Scheduling

If the COMPANY selects this option, an email may be sent to you indicating available dates for scheduling an interview. Once a date is selected by you, it is up to the COMPANY, not HRecruiter, to confirm the scheduling.

This stage occurs only between the COMPANY and Candidate, and HRecruiter is not responsible for the attendance of the parties or feedback on the interview conducted.

## HRecruiter's Responsibility

HRecruiter is responsible for:

- Acting as an intermediary between COMPANIES that publish job opportunities or talent pools and Candidates who publish resumes, build profiles, search for job offers, take tests provided by the tool, and evaluate, anonymously or not, the companies where they work or have worked;
- Offering the resume qualification system for the requirements of the job offer presented by the COMPANY and sought by Candidates using its technology. Qualification is done by mathematical algorithms that use information provided by USERS, which is why HRecruiter is only responsible for the tool's results if the published information is true.

HRecruiter is NOT responsible for:

### a) Jobs Posted by COMPANIES

Opening job positions is the exclusive responsibility of the COMPANY, and HRecruiter is not responsible for the quality, safety, or legality of the positions offered, the veracity or accuracy of listings, and companies' ability to offer job opportunities for Candidates. The publication of positions and their content are the responsibility of the COMPANY, including regarding the hiring model.

### b) Data Provided by Candidates

The data provided by the Candidate is their exclusive responsibility, and HRecruiter cannot be held responsible for errors in filling out data or untruthfulness thereof and the consequences that may arise from this, such as the non-selection of the Candidate for a particular selection process, subsequent disqualification from a selection process in which they were participating, or impossibility of the COMPANY contacting the Candidate due to the fact that direct contact information (phone and email) of the Candidate is hidden or incomplete.

### c) Selection of Candidates for Any Stage of the Selection Process

HRecruiter has no participation in the selection process, qualification, and choice that COMPANIES make in their process, which are the exclusive responsibility of the COMPANY.

### d) Elimination of Candidates in the Selection Process

For the reasons already indicated above, HRecruiter is also not responsible for the elimination of Candidates in the COMPANY's recruitment process.

### e) Direct Negotiation Between Candidate and COMPANY

HRecruiter is not involved in negotiations between COMPANIES and Candidates and is not responsible for the selection or non-selection of Candidates or for delays in the selection process. HRecruiter is not responsible for any information exchanged in direct contact between COMPANY and Candidate via email or phone.

### f) Links to Other Sites

The HRecruiter Platform contains links to third-party sites provided for your convenience and not as an endorsement by HRecruiter of the content on these sites. HRecruiter has no control over and is not responsible for the content, privacy policies, or practices of third-party sites and will not comment on the content or accuracy of third-party materials. If you access the link, the Candidate does so at their own risk.

## Pricing

Your basic registration on the HRecruiter Platform is free and includes creating a page with personal information on the HRecruiter website, the possibility of taking tests for profile and work style mapping, and the possibility of viewing registered companies and positions that match your profile.
